# Scripts
Welcome to my scripts repo. Here you'll find some of the scripts that I have used during my time as a DevOps
Engineer. These scripts have come in handy for the tasks that I have been assigned and have completed. Feel free
to browse them and copy them if you think they'll come in handy! 

Some of the tools and technologies that I have used with these scripts are:
- Python
- Amazon Web Services
